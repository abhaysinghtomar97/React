05-css :

    I used css as a moduler styling by writing separate styling for each componets that prevent to repetetion in the same stylign in different components(like we have 2 different btns..)

06-tailwind:

    One more step towards Feasibility by doing simple styling by Tailwid css

    Here,  'vite.config.js' need to update by importing 'import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'.
    Also in 'index.css'  -> '@import "tailwindcss";'
